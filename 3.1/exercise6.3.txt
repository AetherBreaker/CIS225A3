the first method tests if a match to the inputted string is found at the start of the current string
comparing each character in each string until either reaching the end of the inputted string
upon which it returns true, or until a mismatch is found, upon which it returns false.

the second method does the same as the first, however it instead moves the "starting point"
of the current string to an index position specified by the toffset parameter, before proceeding
to perform the comparison.
